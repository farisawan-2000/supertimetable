# A Cost-effective and Tactical Bus Timetable Device

Utilizing the API from Bustime(R)-compatible transit systems, grab transit times for a stop and show on an E-Paper display. Total Device BOM is around $100 with setup that any hobbyist can accomplish.

# Future Goals
- 3D Printed Weatherproof Case with appropriate ports for mounting to a bus stop sign.
- LTE data connection to get results without an existing Wi-Fi network.
- Search for E-paper display with partial refresh for faster results display.
- Research whether other microcontroller boards (e.g. Pi Zero) will process text faster.
